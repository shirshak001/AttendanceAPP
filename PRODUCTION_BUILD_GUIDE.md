npx eas login
npx eas build --platform android --profile production

# Download APK from Expo dashboard when complete
```

### Option 2: Local Android Build  
```bash
# Prerequisites: Android Studio & SDK installed
# 1. Generate native code
npx expo prebuild --platform android

# 2. Navigate to android directory
cd android

# 3. Build release APK
./gradlew assembleRelease
# or on Windows: gradlew.bat assembleRelease

# 4. Find APK at: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

### Option 3: Development Build for Testing
```bash
# Create development client
npx eas build --profile development --platform android

# Or use expo-dev-client
npx expo install expo-dev-client
npx expo run:android
```
